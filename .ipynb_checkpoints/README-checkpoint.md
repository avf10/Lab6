# CMPINF 0010 Lab 6-7

Our program takes your name as well as your current age, and tells you how old you will be in 5 years. It ensures that the user enters a valid age before calculating their age in 5 years to prevent crashing from invalid input.

## Getting Started 

### Installation Instructions

Our program is a simple program which relies solely on having a machine which supports the Python Language. To install our program, since there is not any application or executable file, you will need to copy the code from the Lab6.ipynb file and input it into an editor which can support Python 3. Since our program is not complicated, there is no tests to be run to ensure installation has proceeded correctly. 

### License
Our program is licensed under a GNU General Public License. This license permits use and modifications and only restricts the sharing of closed-source modifications. Our license does not cover liability or warranty. We chose this license because we have a small team and permits for collaboration of other people and keeps our project accessible to others.

### Execution Instructions
To begin, you will want to copy the contents from the Lab6.ipynb file and paste this into a code cell in an editor of your choice which can support Python 3. Then, you will want to run the program using the editor of your choice. In our case when designing this program, we used Jupyter Notebooks. If the program is executing correctly, you will first be prompted for your name. Then, you will be prompted to enter your age which should be an integer. If your inputs are valid, the program will calculate your age in 5 years.

## Development

### Contributing
To contribute to our program, please feel free to. We only ask that you review the Code of Conduct file found in the main repository before submitting any contributions. This was chosen to be included to keep the program appropriate and accessible to everyone while making sure it is a safe environment for any and all contributors. If you would like to contribute, you can fork the repository on GitHub and copy the Lab6.ipynb file into an editor which supports Python 3 and make any changes you feel necessary before submitting a pull request.

### Team
